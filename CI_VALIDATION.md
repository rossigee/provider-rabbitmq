The provider-rabbitmq repository has been updated with the improved CI/CD approach from provider-cloudflare.

### 🔍 Validation Summary

**✅ Workflow Structure**
- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Updated with modern security and features
- Release workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Updated with latest actions and security

**✅ Security Improvements**
- Action pinning with commit hashes for security
- Updated permissions with attestations and id-token
- Modern Ubuntu 24.04 runner

**✅ Build System Compatibility**
- Makefile updated with correct PROJECT_REPO: `github.com/rossigee/provider-rabbitmq`
- Registry configuration: `ghcr.io/rossigee` (primary)
- Test coverage path: `_output/tests/linux_amd64/coverage.txt` (verified compatible)
- Required make targets exist: `vendor`, `vendor.check`, `check-diff`, `test`, `lint`

**✅ Enhanced Features Added**
- QEMU multi-platform builds
- Improved dependency caching
- Codecov integration with proper file paths
- Parallel testing (`-j2`)
- Workflow dispatch support
- Multiple branch support (master, main, release-*)

**✅ Registry Updates**

- Harbor: Removed - no longer used
- Optional: Upbound (`xpkg.upbound.io/rossigee`) - disabled by default

### 🚀 Key Improvements Over Previous CI

1. **Security**: Commit hash pinning vs version tags
2. **Performance**: Better caching and parallel execution
3. **Reliability**: Enhanced error handling and validation
4. **Features**: Multi-platform builds, modern release notes
5. **Maintainability**: Cleaner workflow structure and comments

### 📋 Validation Steps Completed

- [x] YAML syntax validation (minor warnings only)
- [x] Build system compatibility verification
- [x] Make target availability confirmation
- [x] Test coverage path validation
- [x] Registry configuration alignment
- [x] Action version and security validation

### 🎯 Expected Workflow Behavior

**On Push to Master/Main:**
1. **detect-noop**: Skip duplicate actions
2. **lint**: Code linting with golangci-lint
3. **check-diff**: Verify generated code is up-to-date
4. **unit-tests**: Run tests with coverage reporting
5. **publish-artifacts**: Build and publish to ghcr.io/rossigee

**On Release Tag (v*):**
1. **Build and test**: Full validation pipeline
2. **Multi-registry publish**: Primary + optional registries
3. **GitHub release**: Automatic release notes generation

## ✅ Validation Complete

The CI/CD improvements have been successfully applied and validated. The provider-rabbitmq now has the same modern, secure, and feature-rich CI/CD pipeline as provider-cloudflare.
